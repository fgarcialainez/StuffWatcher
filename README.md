StuffWatcher
============

The idea of this project is to create a simple iOS 8 Swift application that takes advantage of hardware devices in order to track different types of stuff. These hardware devices were also designed during the development of this project.

This application is only a prototype that works with mock data (it is not integrated with a real backend / API) and simulates several interactions with the mentioned hardware devices (those devices were designed but no manufactured).

This project was developed as a module of the Postgraduate in Agile Project & Product Management at IEBS.
